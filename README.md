# Laravel Route Restrictor

Laravel Route Restrictor is a middleware package designed to restrict a entire site or specific routes using HTTP basic authentication. It is compatible with Laravel 5.1 or above.

## Setup

1. Run `composer require divineomega/laravel-route-restrictor`.
2. Add `DivineOmega\LaravelRouteRestrictor\Providers\LaravelRouteRestrictorServiceProvider::class` to the `$providers` array in your `config/app.php` file.
3. Run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="\DivineOmega\LaravelRouteRestrictor\Providers\LaravelRouteRestrictorServiceProvider"`.
3. Add `DivineOmega\LaravelRouteRestrictor\Http\Middleware\BasicAuthentication::class` to the `$middleware` array in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.
4. Add `'routeRestrictor' => \DivineOmega\LaravelRouteRestrictor\Http\Middleware\BasicAuthentication::class` to the `$routeMiddleware` array in your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.
5. Add `RewriteRule .* - [E=REMOTE_USER:%{HTTP:Authorization}]` immediately below `RewriteEngine On` in your `public/.htaccess` file. This is required for web servers that are configured to use CGI as their PHP handler.

## Global restriction

In order to restrict all routes in your Laravel application, just add the global username and password to your `config/laravel-route-restrictor.php` file. Your entire application will then be protected by these details, unless a route specific restriction is in place.

## Restricting specific routes

To restrict specific routes, you must edit your routing file at `app/Http/routes.php`. Simply surround the route or routes you want to restrict with the following route group code. Ensure you change the `username` and `password` middleware parameters.

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => 'routeRestrictor:username:password'], function () {
    // Route(s) to restrict go here
});
```

Note: If you have both route specific restrictions and a global restriction, both will work, but route specific restrictions will take priority.

## Excluding specific routes from restriction

If you wish to exclude one or more routes from restriction, you must edit your routing file at `app/Http/routes.php`. Simply surround the route or routes you want to exclude with the following route group code.

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => 'routeRestrictor:disable'], function () {
    // Route(s) to exclude from restriction go here
});
```
